**Identify command**


**Identify command overview**


The Identify command returns a data buffer that describes information about the NVM subsystem, the
domain, the controller or the namespace(s). The data structure is 4,096 bytes in size.


The Identify command uses the Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, Command Dword 11, and Command
Dword 14 fields. All other command specific fields are reserved.


**Figure 307: Identify – Data Pointer**





|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|127:00|**Data Pointer (DPTR):**This field specifies the start of the data buffer. Refer to Figure 92 for the definition<br>of this field. If using PRPs, this field shall not be a pointer to a PRP List as the data buffer may not cross<br>more than one page boundary.|

|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|31:16|**Controller Identifier (CNTID):**This field specifies the controller identifier used as part of some Identify<br>operations. Whether the CNTID field is used for a particular Identify operation is indicated in Figure 311.<br>If this field is not used as part of the Identify operation, then:<br>• <br>host software shall clear this field to 0h for backwards compatibility (0h is a valid controller<br>identifier); and<br>• <br>the controller shall ignore this field.<br>Controllers that support the Namespace Management capability (refer to section 8.1.15) shall support<br>this field.|
|15:08|Reserved|
|07:00|**Controller or Namespace Structure (CNS):**This field specifies the information to be returned to the<br>host. Refer to Figure 311.|


**Figure 309: Identify – Command Dword 11**







|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|31:24|**Command Set Identifier (CSI):** This field is CNS value specific. This field specifies the I/O Command<br>Set to be used by the command for CNS values that require a Command Set Identifier. Refer to Figure<br>311 for Identify command CNS values that use this field. This field shall be cleared to 0h for Identify<br>operations with CNS values that do not use this field.<br>Values for this field are defined by Figure 312.|
|23:16|Reserved|
|15:00|**CNS Specific Identifier (CNSSID):** This field is dependent on the specified CNS value and if not defined<br>by that CNS value, then this field is reserved.|


If the controller supports selection of a UUID by the Identify command (refer to section 8.1.28), then
Command Dword 14 is used to specify a UUID Index value (refer to Figure 310).


**Figure 310: Identify – Command Dword 14**

|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|31:07|Reserved|
|06:00|**UUID Index (UIDX):** Refer to Figure 659.|



The data structure returned is based on the Controller or Namespace Structure (CNS) field as shown in
Figure 311. If there are fewer entries to return for the data structure indicated based on CNS value, then
the unused portion of the returned data is zero filled. If a controller does not support the specified CNS
value, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.


When issuing the Identify command, if the specified namespace is not associated with an I/O Command
Set that supports the specified Identify CNS value (refer to Figure 311), then the controller shall abort the
command with a status code of Invalid I/O Command Set.


Note: The CNS field was specified as a one bit field in revision 1.0 and is a two bit field in revision 1.1. Host
software should only issue CNS values defined in revision 1.0 to controllers compliant with revision 1.0.
Host software should only issue CNS values defined in revision 1.1 to controllers compliant with revision
1.1. The results of issuing other CNS values to controllers compliant with revision 1.0 or revision 1.1,
respectively, are indeterminate.


The Identify Controller data structure, Identify Namespace data structure, and the I/O Command Set
specific Identify Namespace data structure include several unique identifiers. The format and layout of these
unique identifiers is described in section 4.7.1.

**5.1.13.2.2** **Active Namespace ID list (CNS 02h)**


A list of 1,024 namespace IDs is returned to the host containing active NSIDs in increasing order that are
greater than the value specified in the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field of the command. The controller
shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format if the NSID field is set to
FFFFFFFEh or FFFFFFFFh. The NSID field may be cleared to 0h to retrieve a Namespace List including
the namespace starting with NSID of 1h. The data structure returned is a Namespace List (refer to section
4.6.2).


**5.1.13.2.3** **Namespace Identification Descriptor list (CNS 03h)**


A list of Namespace Identification Descriptor structures (refer to Figure 316) is returned to the host for the
specified namespace if the value in the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field is an active NSID. The controller
shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format if the NSID field is set to
FFFFFFFEh or is set to FFFFFFFFh.Namespace Identification Descriptor structures consist of one or more
Namespace Identifiers (NID) of various types as indicated by the Namespace Identifier Type (NIDT) field
in each descriptor. Each NID is assigned to a namespace at namespace creation and remains fixed
throughout the life of that namespace. If the NSID field does not specify an active NSID, then refer to section
3.2.1.5 for the status code to return. Textual representations related to Boot of NIDs may be found in the
NVM Express Boot Specification.


The contents of the Namespace Identification Descriptor list is preserved across namespace and controller
operations (e.g., Controller Level Reset, namespace format, etc.).

NVM Express [®] Base Specification, Revision 2.2


The controller may return any number of variable length Namespace Identification Descriptor structures
that fit into the 4,096 byte Identify payload. All remaining bytes after the Namespace Identification Descriptor
structures should be cleared to 0h, and the host shall interpret a Namespace Identifier Descriptor Length
(NIDL) value of 0h as the end of the list. The host should ignore any Namespace Identification Descriptor
with a Namespace Identifier Type not supported by the host.


A controller shall not return multiple Namespace Identification Descriptors with the same Namespace
Identifier Type (NIDT). A controller shall return:


  - at least one Namespace Identification Descriptor identifying the namespace (i.e., NIDT field set to
1h, 2h, or 3h); and

  - A Namespace Identification Descriptor identifying the I/O Command Set (i.e., NIDT field set to 4h)

An I/O Command Set specific Identify Namespace data structure (refer to the applicable I/O Command Set
specification) is returned to the host for the specified namespace if the value in the Namespace Identifier
(NSID) field is an active NSID. If the value in the NSID field specifies an inactive NSID, then the controller
returns a zero filled data structure.


The specific Identify Namespace data structure that is returned by this command is specified by the
Command Set Identifier (CSI) field (refer to Figure 312). If the I/O Command Set associated with the
specified namespace does not support the Identify Namespace data structure specified by the CSI field,
then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.


330


NVM Express [®] Base Specification, Revision 2.2


Each I/O Command Set specific Identify Namespace data structure specifies fields that define capabilities
used by a host to format or create a namespace. If the NSID field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller
shall return an I/O Command Set specific Identify Namespace data structure for the I/O Command Set
specified in the CSI field (refer to Figure 312) that has:


  - the capability fields as specified by the I/O Command Set specific Identify Namespace data
structure that requires a value that is the same value for all namespaces formatted using the User
Data Formats associated with the Number of LBA Formats field; and

  - fields that are not capability fields set to the value 0h.


If the controller supports the Namespace Management capability (refer to section 8.1.15) and the NSID
field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall return an I/O Command Set specific Identify Namespace
data structure for the I/O Command Set specified in the CSI field.


If the controller does not support the Namespace Management capability and the NSID field is set to
FFFFFFFFh, then the controller may abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or
Format.


**5.1.13.2.6** **I/O Command Set specific Identify Controller data structure (CNS 06h)**


An I/O Command Set specific Identify Controller data structure is returned to the host for the controller
processing the command. The specific Identify Controller data structure that is returned by this command
is specified by the Command Set Identifier (CSI) field (refer to Figure 312). Data structures for specific I/O
Command Sets are optionally defined by the I/O Command Set specifications. If the I/O Command Set
specified by the CSI field does not have an Identify Controller data structure, then the controller shall return
a zero filled data structure. If the host requests a data structure for an I/O Command Set that the controller
does not support, the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.


**5.1.13.2.7** **I/O Command Set specific Active Namespace ID list (CNS 07h)**


A list of 1,024 namespace IDs is returned to the host containing active NSIDs in increasing order that are
greater than the value specified in the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field of the command as specified by
the Command Set Identifier (CSI) field of the command. Only namespaces associated with the I/O
Command Set specified by the CSI value are returned. For CSI values that are not supported or not enabled
the command is aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.


The controller should abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format if the NSID
field is set to FFFFFFFEh or FFFFFFFFh. The NSID field may be cleared to 0h to retrieve a Namespace
List including the namespace starting with NSID of 1h. The data structure returned is a Namespace List
(refer to section 4.6.2).


**5.1.13.2.8** **I/O Command Set Independent Identify Namespace data structure (CNS 08h)**


If the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field specifies an active NSID, then the I/O Command Set Independent
Identify Namespace data structure (refer to Figure 320) is returned to the host for that specified namespace.
If the value in the NSID field specifies an inactive NSID, then the controller returns a zero filled data
structure.


The Reported column in Figure 320 specifies fields in the I/O Command Set Independent Identify
Namespace data structure that define namespace capabilities used by a host to format or create a
namespace. If the NSID field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall return an I/O Command Set
Independent Identify Namespace data structure that:


  - for fields in Figure 320 that indicate “Yes” in the Reported column, contain the same value for all
namespaces; and

  - for fields in Figure 320 that indicate “No” in the Reported column, contain a value cleared to 0h.


If the controller supports the Namespace Management capability (refer to section 8.1.15) and the NSID
field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall return an I/O Command Set Independent Identify
Namespace data structure. If the controller does not support the Namespace Management capability and


331


NVM Express [®] Base Specification, Revision 2.2


the NSID field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller may abort the command with a status code of Invalid
Namespace or Format.

**5.1.13.2.9** **Allocated Namespace ID list (CNS 10h)**


A list of up to 1,024 namespace IDs is returned to the host containing allocated NSIDs in increasing order
that are greater than the value specified in the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field of the Identify command.


The controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format if the NSID field
is set to FFFFFFFEh or FFFFFFFFh. The NSID field may be cleared to 0h to retrieve a Namespace List
including the namespace starting with NSID of 1h. The data structure returned is a Namespace List (refer
to section 4.6.2).


**5.1.13.2.10** **Identify Namespace data structure for an Allocated Namespace ID (CNS 11h)**


The Identify Namespace data structure (refer to the NVM Command Set Specification) is returned to the
host for the specified namespace if the value in the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field is an allocated NSID.
If the value in the NSID field specifies an unallocated NSID, then the controller returns a zero filled data
structure. If the specified namespace is not associated with an I/O Command Set that specifies logical
blocks (e.g., the NVM Command Set), then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of
Invalid I/O Command Set.


If the value in the NSID field specifies an invalid NSID, then the controller shall abort the command with a
status code of Invalid Namespace or Format. If the NSID field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall
abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format.


**5.1.13.2.11** **Namespace Attached Controller list (CNS 12h)**


A Controller List (refer to section 4.6.1) of up to 2,047 controller identifiers is returned containing a controller
identifier greater than or equal to the value specified in the Controller Identifier (CDW10.CNTID) field. The
list contains controller identifiers of controllers that have the specified namespace attached. If the NSID
field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in
Command.


**5.1.13.2.12** **Controller list (CNS 13h)**


A Controller List (refer to section 4.6.1) of up to 2,047 controller identifiers of I/O controllers is returned
containing controller identifiers greater than or equal to the value specified in the Controller Identifier
(CDW10.CNTID) field.


**5.1.13.2.13** **Namespace Granularity List (CNS 16h)**


If the controller supports reporting of Namespace Granularity refer to the applicable I/O Command Set
specification for details.


The controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid I/O Command Set if the Command Set
Identifier is not associated with an I/O Command Set that supports the Namespace Granularity List.


**5.1.13.2.14** **UUID List (CNS 17h)**


The format of the UUID List is defined in Figure 321. Each UUID List entry is either 0h, the NVMe Invalid
UUID, or a valid UUID. Valid UUIDs are those which are non-zero and are not the NVMe Invalid UUID (refer
to section 8.1.28).


If the UUID List bit is set to ‘1’ in the Controller Attributes (CTRATT) field in the Identify Controller data
structure (refer to Figure 313), then:


  - The UUID List shall contain at least one valid UUID (refer to section 8.1.28);

  - The UUID 1 field shall contain a non-zero value; and

  - A UUID field cleared to 0h indicates the end of the UUID List.


The list may be in any order.

**5.1.13.2.17** **I/O Command Set specific Allocated Namespace ID list (CNS 1Ah)**


A list of up to 1,024 namespace IDs is returned to the host containing allocated NSIDs in increasing order
that are greater than the value specified in the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field of the Identify command
and as specified by the Command Set Identifier (CSI) field of the command. Only NSIDs for namespaces
associated with the I/O Command Set specified in CSI are returned. For CSI values not supported by the
controller the command is aborted with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.


The controller should abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format if the NSID
field is set to FFFFFFFEh or FFFFFFFFh. The NSID field may be cleared to 0h to retrieve a Namespace
List including the namespace starting with NSID of 1h. The data structure returned is a Namespace List
(refer to section 4.6.2).


**5.1.13.2.18** **I/O Command Set specific Identify Namespace data structure for an Allocated**
**Namespace ID (CNS 1Bh)**


An I/O Command Set specific Identify Namespace data structure (refer to section 5.1.13.2.5) is returned to
the host for the specified namespace if the value in the Namespace Identifier (NSID) field is an allocated
NSID. If the value in the NSID field is an unallocated NSID, then the controller returns a zero filled data
structure.


The specific Identify Namespace data structure that is returned by this command is specified by the
Command Set Identifier (CSI) field in the command (refer to Figure 312). If the I/O Command Set associated
with the specified namespace does not support the specific Identify Namespace data structure specified by
the CSI field, then the controller shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.


If the value in the NSID field is an invalid NSID, then the controller shall abort the command with a status
code of Invalid Namespace or Format. If the NSID field is set to FFFFFFFFh, then the controller should
abort the command with a status code of Invalid Namespace or Format.


**5.1.13.2.19** **Identify I/O Command Set data structure (CNS 1Ch)**


The Identify I/O Command Set data structure (refer to Figure 328) is returned to the host for the controller
specified in the Controller ID (CNTID) field of the command if the CNTID field does not have a value of
FFFFh. If the CNTID field has a value of FFFFh, then the Identify I/O Command Set data structure is
returned to the host for the controller processing the command.


This CNS value shall be implemented if the CAP.CSS.IOCSS bit is set to ‘1’.


The Identify I/O Command Set data structure consists of an array of I/O Command Set Vectors (refer to
Figure 329) that describe the I/O Command Sets that the controller supports and the combination of
supported I/O Command Sets that may be simultaneously used. The I/O Command Set Profile Feature
value indicates the index of the I/O Command Set Combination that is currently selected (refer to section
5.1.25.1.17). I/O Command Set Combination 0 has an index value of 0h, I/O Command Set Combination 1
has an index value of 1h, and so on. Only I/O Command Sets that have a bit set to ‘1’ in the I/O Command
Set Vector of the I/O Command Set Combination selected by the I/O Command Set Profile Feature value
may be used. All other I/O Command Sets are treated as unsupported I/O Command Sets.
