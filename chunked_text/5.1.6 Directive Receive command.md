**Directive Receive command**


The Directive Receive command returns a data buffer that is dependent on the Directive Type. Refer to
section 8.1.8.


The Directive Receive command uses the Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, and Command Dword 11
fields. Command Dword 12 and Dword 13 may be used based on the Directive Type field and the Directive
Operation field. All other command specific fields are reserved.


If the Number of Dwords (NUMD) field corresponds to a length that is less than the size of the data structure
to be returned, then only that specified portion of the data structure is transferred. If the NUMD field
corresponds to a length that is greater than the size of the associated data structure, then the entire contents
of the data structure are transferred and no additional data is transferred.

**Command Completion**


When the command is completed, the controller posts a completion queue entry to the Admin Completion
Queue indicating the status for the command. Command specific status values that may be returned are
dependent on the Directive Type, refer to section 8.1.8.
