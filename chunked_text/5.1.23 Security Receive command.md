**Security Receive command**


The Security Receive command transfers the status and data result of one or more Security Send
commands that were previously submitted to the controller.


The association between a Security Receive command and previous Security Send commands is
dependent on the Security Protocol. The format of the data to be transferred is dependent on the Security
Protocol. Refer to SPC-5 for Security Protocol details.


Each Security Receive command returns the appropriate data corresponding to a Security Send command
as defined by the rules of the Security Protocol. The Security Receive command data may not be retained
if there is a loss of communication between the controller and host, or if a Controller Level Reset occurs.

NVM Express [®] Base Specification, Revision 2.2


The fields used are Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, and Command Dword 11 fields. All other command
specific fields are reserved.


**Figure 376: Security Receive – Data Pointer**

|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|127:00|**Data Pointer (DPTR):**This field specifies the start of the data buffer. Refer to Figure 92 for the definition<br>of this field.|



**Figure 377: Security Receive – Command Dword 10**







|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|31:24|**Security Protocol (SECP):**This field specifies the security protocol as defined in SPC-5. The controller<br>shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command if an unsupported value of the<br>Security Protocol is specified.|
|23:16|**SP Specific 1 (SPSP1):**The value of this field contains bits 15:08 of the Security Protocol Specific field<br>as defined in SPC-5.|
|15:08|**SP Specific 0 (SPSP0):**The value of this field contains bits 07:00 of the Security Protocol Specific field<br>as defined in SPC-5.|
|07:00|**NVMe Security Specific Field (NSSF):**Refer to Figure 379 for definition of this field for Security Protocol<br>EAh. For all other Security Protocols this field is reserved.|


**Figure 378: Security Receive – Command Dword 11**

|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|31:00|**Allocation Length (AL):** The value of this field is specific to the Security Protocol In command with the<br>INC_512 field cleared to 0h as defined in SPC-5.|



**Command Completion**


If the command is completed, then the controller shall post a completion queue entry to the Admin
Completion Queue indicating the status for the command.


**Security Protocol 00h**


A Security Receive command with the Security Protocol field cleared to 00h shall return information about
the security protocols supported by the controller. This command is used in the security discovery process
and is not associated with a Security Send command. Refer to SPC-5 for the details of Security Protocol
00h and the SP Specific field.


**Security Protocol EAh**


Security Protocol EAh is assigned for NVMe interface use (refer to ACS-4). This protocol may be used in
Security Receive and Security Send commands. The specific usage type is defined by the Security Protocol
Specific Field defined in Figure 379.
