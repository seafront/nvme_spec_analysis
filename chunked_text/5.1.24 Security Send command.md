**Security Send command**


The Security Send command is used to transfer security protocol data to the controller. The data structure
transferred to the controller as part of this command contains security protocol specific commands to be
performed by the controller. The data structure transferred may also contain data or parameters associated
with the security protocol commands. Status and data that is to be returned to the host for the security

protocol commands submitted by a Security Send command are retrieved with the Security Receive
command defined in section 5.1.23.


The association between a Security Send command and subsequent Security Receive command is
Security Protocol field dependent as defined in SPC-5.


The fields used are Data Pointer, Command Dword 10, and Command Dword 11 fields. All other command
specific fields are reserved.

|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|127:00|**Data Pointer (DPTR):**This field specifies the start of the data buffer. Refer to Figure 92 for the definition<br>of this field.|



**Figure 381: Security Send – Command Dword 10**







|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|31:24|**Security Protocol (SECP):**This field specifies the security protocol as defined in SPC-5. The controller<br>shall abort the command with a status code of Invalid Field in Command if a reserved value of the<br>Security Protocol is specified.|
|23:16|**SP Specific 1 (SPSP1):**The value of this field contains bits 15:08 of the Security Protocol Specific field<br>as defined in SPC-5.|
|15:08|**SP Specific 0 (SPSP0):**The value of this field contains bits 07:00 of the Security Protocol Specific field<br>as defined in SPC-5.|
|07:00|**NVMe Security Specific Field (NSSF):**Refer to Figure 379 for definition of this field for Security Protocol<br>EAh. For all other Security Protocols this field is reserved.|


**Figure 382: Security Send – Command Dword 11**

|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|31:00|**Transfer Length (TL):** The value of this field is specific to the Security Protocol Out command with the<br>INC_512 field cleared to 0h as defined in SPC-5.|



**Command Completion**


If the command is completed, then the controller shall post a completion queue entry to the Admin
Completion Queue indicating the status for the command.
