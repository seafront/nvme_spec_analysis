|31:11|Reserved|
|10|**Enter Media Verification State (EMVS):** If this bit is set to '1', then the Media Verification state shall be entered if sanitize processing completes successfully.|
|09|**No-Deallocate After Sanitize (NDAS):** If this bit is set to '1' and No-Deallocate Inhibited bit is cleared to '0', then the controller shall not deallocate any media allocated for user data.|
|08|**Overwrite Invert Pattern Between Passes (OIPBP):** If this bit is set to '1', then the Overwrite Pattern shall be inverted between passes.|
|07:04|**Overwrite Pass Count (OWPASS):** This field specifies the number of overwrite passes. A value of 0h specifies 16 overwrite passes.|
|03|**Allow Unrestricted Sanitize Exit (AUSE):** If this bit is set to '1', then sanitize processing is performed in unrestricted completion mode.|
|02:00|**Sanitize Action (SANACT):** This field specifies the sanitize action to perform.|
