|Bits|Description|
|---|---|
|1|**Management Endpoint FW Overlap (MEFWO):** If this bit is set to '1', then the controller detected an overlapping firmware/boot partition image update command sequence due to processing a command from a Management Endpoint. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller did not detect an overlapping firmware/boot partition image update command sequence due to processing a command from a Management Endpoint.|
|0|**Admin Submission Queue FW Overlap (ASQFWO):** If this bit is set to '1', then the controller detected an overlapping firmware/boot partition image update command sequence due to processing a command from an Admin Submission Queue on a controller. If this bit is cleared to '0', then the controller did not detect an overlapping firmware/boot partition image update command sequence due to processing a command from an Admin Submission Queue on a controller.|
