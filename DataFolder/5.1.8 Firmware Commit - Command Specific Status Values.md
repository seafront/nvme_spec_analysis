**Figure 184: Firmware Commit – Command Specific Status Values**

|Value|Definition|
|---|---|
|06h|**Invalid Firmware Slot:** The firmware slot indicated is invalid or read only. This error is indicated if the firmware slot exceeds the number supported.|
|07h|**Invalid Firmware Image:** The firmware image specified for activation is: invalid and not loaded by the controller; or the specified firmware slot does not contain a firmware image.|
|0Bh|**Firmware Activation Requires Conventional Reset:** The firmware commit was successful; however, activation of the firmware image requires a Conventional Reset. (refer to the NVM Express NVMe over PCIe Transport Specification). If a Function Level Reset or Controller Reset occurs prior to a Conventional Reset, the controller shall continue operation with the currently executing firmware image.|
|10h|**Firmware Activation Requires NVM Subsystem Reset:** The firmware commit was successful; however, activation of the firmware image requires an NVM Subsystem Reset. If any other type of Controller Level Reset occurs prior to an NVM Subsystem Reset, the controller shall continue operation with the currently executing firmware image.|
|11h|**Firmware Activation Requires Controller Level Reset:** The firmware commit was successful; however, the firmware image specified does not support being activated without a Controller Level Reset. The firmware image shall be activated at the next Controller Level Reset. This status code should be returned only if the Commit Action field in the Firmware Commit command is set to 011b (i.e., activate immediately).|
|12h|**Firmware Activation Requires Maximum Time Violation:** The firmware commit was successful; however, the firmware image was not activated. Activation of the specified firmware image requires more time than the amount indicated in the Maximum Time for Firmware Activation (MTFA) field in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 313). To activate the firmware image committed to the specified firmware slot, a Firmware Commit command specifying a Commit Action set to 010b may be issued as described in section 3.11.|
|13h|**Firmware Activation Prohibited:** The image specified is being prohibited from activation by the controller for vendor specific reasons (e.g., controller does not support down revision firmware).|
|14h|**Overlapping Range:** This error is indicated if the controller detects that the firmware image has overlapping ranges.|
|1Eh|**Boot Partition Write Prohibited:** This error is indicated if a command attempts to modify a Boot Partition while write locked (refer to section 8.1.3.3).|
